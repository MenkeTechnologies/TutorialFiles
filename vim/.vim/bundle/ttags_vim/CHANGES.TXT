CHANGES
0.1
Initial release

0.2
- The kind argument was introduced (i.e. the argument list has changed)
- * was defined as "match any".

0.3
- Configuration via [wbg]:ttags_kinds, [wbg]:ttags_tags_rx, 
[wbg]:ttags_file_rx variables
- The list includes the kind identifier and the entries are highlighted 
(see g:ttags_highlighting)
- If tSkeleton (vimscript #1160) is installed and if g:tskelTypes 
contains "tags", <c-t> will insert the tag in the buffer including (if 
supported by tSkeleton for the current filetype) a template for the 
argument list.
- g:ttags_world can be a normal dictionary (use tlib#input#ListD instead
of #ListW)
- Require tlib 0.14

0.4
- New: ttags#Select() that matches any field
- New: TTagselect command that takes a key list as argument to match any 
field.
- New: [wbg]:ttags_constraints configuration variable (a dictionary with 
regexps).
- If the commands TTags and TTagselect are called with [!], 
g:tlib_tags_extra is used to temporarily scan additional tag files.
- If a variable [bg]:ttags_rewrite is defined, it is used as function 
name to rewrite tag filesname (eg to prevent name incompatibilities 
between cygwin ctag & windows vim).
- "[wbg]:ttags_tags_rx" was renamed to "[wbg]:ttags_name_rx"
- "[wbg]:ttags_file_rx" was renamed to "[wbg]:ttags_filename_rx"
- g:ttags_display: Alternatively use "locations" or "quickfix" lists to 
display the tags (default: "tlib").
- Require tlib 0.19
- Previously, all tags were retrieved and filtered only later on. The 
idea was to save time by caching the tags information. Now the initial 
filtering by name is done by |taglist()| right away, which seems faster.

0.5
- More compact view of tags (via |g:tlib_tag_substitute|)
- When previewing tags, restore the original position when closing the tags list
- g:ttags_match_front, g:ttags_match_end
- Require tlib >= 0.20

0.6
- Use pathshorten()
- Require tlib >= 0.21
- FIX: Use ListW()
- Make sure tlib is loaded even if it is installed in a different 
rtp-directory.
- temporarily set nomagic when running the tag command
- Show tags in the current file: TTags * * .

0.7
- Moved the definition of some variables from plugin/ttags.vim to autoload/ttags.vim
