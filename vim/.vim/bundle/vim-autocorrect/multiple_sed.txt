# These are some regular expressions that express common multi-word corrections.
#
# I do not think that most of these will work as-is in Vim (they were originally devised for sed.)
# At this time I do not think that Vim supports multi-word abbreviations / corrections, but
# at some point this might be nice to do, so I'm creating a file that contains this information
# so if Vim ever does support it or we think of more of this type, we have
# somewhere to put them. This file should be reviewed for sensibleness before
# doing anything with it though.
