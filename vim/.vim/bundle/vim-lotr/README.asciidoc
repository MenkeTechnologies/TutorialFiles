LOTR
----

__Lord of the Regs__

TIP: If you like vim-lotr and want to share the W00t!, I'm grateful for

LOTR displays a persistent view of your Vim `:registers` in a sidebar window.

== Commands

* `:LOTROpen`
* `:LOTRClose`
* `:LOTRToggle` also available through `<PLUG>LOTRToggle` which is mapped to `<leader>cr` by default.

== Within the LOTR window:

* `q` closes the LOTR window
* `<space>` toggles zoom mode
* `<cr>` returns to the prior window

== YankStack

LOTR now shows the :Yanks list from the YankStack plugin. +
Disable this by adding this line to your `~/.vimrc`:

  let g:lotr_yankstack = 0
