Markology provides for the visualization, navigation, and management of Vim's
(marks).  Visualization is through use of Vim's `sign` feature, and so use of
this plugin requires that Vim be compiled with the `sign` option.

Markology displays marks associated with the current line in the sign column or
gutter of the window displaying the buffer (with the entire line highlighted
in a different color, if so desired).  You can easily add ("`m+`"), delete
("`m-`"), or toggle ("`m<SPACE>`" or "`m,`") marks associated with the current line.  You can
easily jump through the sequence of all the local marks in the buffer, either
spatially ("`m]`" and "`m[`") or lexicographically ("`m}`" and "`m{`").  You can
also easily display all current marks in the location list window ("`m?`") or
the quickfix window ("`m~`").

Markology is a Frankenstein-ian beast that seamlessly amalgamates and
streamlines (the best) parts of:

    1.  ShowMarks

            ShowMarks - Visually show the location of marks
            Version 2.2 (2004-08-06)
            http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=152
            By Anthony Kruize <trandor@labyrinth.net.au>
            Michael Geddes <michaelrgeddes@optushome.com.au>

    2.  The patch for the above, as given here:

            http://easwy.com/blog/archives/advanced-vim-skills-advanced-move-method/

        which fixes the issue of global marks showing up in files in which they
        were *not* declared.

    3. Mark_Tools

Like "ShowMarks", Markology provides visual representation of |marks| local to a
buffer by placing a |sign| in the leftmost column of the buffer indicating the
label of the mark and its location.

Markology is activated by the |CursorHold| |autocommand| which is triggered
every |updatetime| milliseconds.  This is set to 4000(4 seconds) by default.
If this is too slow, setting it to a lower value will make it more responsive.

Like "Mark_Tools", Markology provides commands and keymaps for navigating
between |marks| and listing/viewing  |marks| .

Note: This plugin requires Vim 6.x compiled with the |+signs| feature.
